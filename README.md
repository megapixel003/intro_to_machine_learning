## BTVN_2

- Solving the weight prediction problem using **Linear Regression**


## BTVN_3

- Comparison of three gradient descent learning algorithms: **batch gradient descent (BGD)**, **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)** and **mini-batch gradient descent (MBGD)**
- Construct an objective function with a given formula and constraints.


## BTVN_4
